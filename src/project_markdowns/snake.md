# Snake

A Snake game made with RPG Maker MV. This is mostly an experiment about what I can do with RPG Maker MV's javascript engine

## Achievements

- Implemented snake with additional obstacles
- Wrote the game mostly in js script and not much with the built-in editor
- Customized build script to minimize js scripts for web deployments
